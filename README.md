# Student-Attendance-System-by-Facial-Recognition
A student attendance system using facial recognition is an innovative application of computer vision technology. Traditional attendance systems often rely on manual methods such as calling out names or using barcode scanners, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Facial recognition-based attendance systems automate this process by using face detection and recognition techniques to identify and mark the presence of students.

In this project, you'll leverage Python and various libraries like OpenCV, dlib, and face_recognition to build a system that can recognize students' faces, compare them against a database, and record their attendance automatically
